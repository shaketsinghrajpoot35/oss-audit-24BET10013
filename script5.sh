# Script 5: Open Source Manifesto Generator
# Author: [YOUR NAME]  | Reg No: [YOUR REG NO]
# Course: Open Source Software | Chosen Software: Python
# Purpose: Asks the user 3 questions interactively and
#          generates a personalised open source manifesto,
#          then saves it to a .txt file
# ============================================================

# -- Alias concept demonstrated (as comment per task requirement) --
# In a real shell session you could set: alias today='date +%d\ %B\ %Y'
# We use the date command directly below instead

# -- Get current date for the manifesto --
DATE=$(date '+%d %B %Y')

# -- Define output filename using the current user's name --
OUTPUT="manifesto_$(whoami).txt"
